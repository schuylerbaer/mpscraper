# Mountain Project For Sale Scraper

New climbing shoes are expensive. I buy most of my shoes used on the forum section of Mountain Project, a rock climbing route database. Instead of manually checking the forum for the shoes I want, I decided to make this web scraper along with a web app for easy use.

## Getting started

* Head over to the [website](https://mpforsalescraper.onrender.com/)
* Click sign up, create your account, and log in

  * Username must be between 5-20 characters
  * Password must be between 8-32 characters

## Dashboard

This is where your trackers are created and stored. To add a tracker:
* Click add tracker
* Enter the brand, model, and size of the shoe you want
* Click create

Your tracker should now appear on your dashboard. When enabled, your tracker will send you an email with a link to the forum if it finds the shoe you want. You can edit and delete any tracker, or you can simply disable it if you wish to stop receiving alerts for that shoe.

## Profile

Your profile is where your account information is stored. Here you can edit:

* The email at which you wish to receive for sale notifications
* Your username
* Your password
  
Make sure you remember your username and password as there is currently no way to retrieve them if they are lost!
